## How to Use this Interactive Chart

- After the default chart loads, the user needs to hit the "Submit" button to create a new chart after changing parameters. It might take a few moments for both the initial chart and subsequent charts to load. Once loaded, the default way to alter the view of the graph is to hold the left mouse button while moving the mouse to spin the 3-D plot in a turntable manner. Other options, among them panning and orbital rotation, are available by clicking the icons on the small menu on the top right of the chart area.

<li>There are several parameters to choose from to create different plots:
<ul>
<li>The user can choose baseball players from a specific team or all players from all teams. The latter option is controlled by the checkmark box in the sidebar. Only when "All Teams" is unselected does the individual team selection dropdown box appear.

<li>The user can choose which baseball season's stats to display on the chart. They range from the years 2000 to 2016.

<li>The user can use a slider to select the minimum amount of plate appearances (chances to hit) for a player to appear on the chart. The default is 502 because this is the minimum required for a player to be qualified for the batting title (highest batting average for the season). This is abbreviated as "PA".</ul></ul></p>

- The three axes of the chart are Batting runs, Fielding runs (saved), and Baserunning runs. Approximately 10 runs equal one "win" or "WAR". 

- The color of each player's dot gets brighter as the player has a higher WAR (as the player gets better).

- More information is in the "Background" tab.
